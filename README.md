This is the 2nd Project of TOP(The Odin Project)

This game plays 5 rounds of Rock Paper Scissors. The html is empty and everything is done on the console tab of developer's tools.

The game starts by asking the user to input rock, paper or scissors(case insensitive). If the user inputs neither of the three, it will ask it to input again.

After each round is decided, the user will be notified of the result and the win/lose/draw score will be updated and shown.
